* Con replace coloro (tramite opzione "format") in base a ~*, con una parola a caso ("dog"). A quel punto rifaccio replace, senza vincoli di format e rimpiazzo "dog" con nulla.


* There are two kinds of difference between both commands. The first one is that with "corr", Stata uses listwise deletion. That is, the correlation matrix is computed only for those cases which do not have any missing value in any of the variables on the list. In contrast, "pwcorr" uses pairwise deletion; in other words, each correlation is computed for all cases that do not have missing values for this specific pair of variables.

* Note: as far as large conglomerates are concerned, when assigning an industry (TMT, Life Science) -> it was assigned only if there was a significantly dominant business line (e.g. GE, Siemens, Softbank did not have one), in terms of revenues.
* Similarly for high tech category, but in this case considering all the high tech business lines.

* HighTech variable values assigned according to "Eurostat indicators on High-tech industry and Knowledge – intensive services".
